# Taskwarrior why it is the best TODO list

## Quid

This is an export of the Taskwarrior presentation.

Originally contained in my obsidian Repository. (<https://obsidian.md/>).
It was originally displayed as slides using the obsidian plugin
"advanced slides". (<https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides>)

PLEASE READ HERE : <./Taskwarrior.md>

## Note: syncing between obsidian repo and this repo

Use Vim with plugin DirDiff to sync between the two repos.

```vim
:let  g:DirDiffExcludes =".git,README.md"
:DirDiff . ../obsidian/obsperso/Projets/perso/Pr√©sentation\ taskwarrior/
```

<!-- vim:set conceallevel=0 : -->
